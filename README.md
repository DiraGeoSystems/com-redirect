# Redirect to dirageosystems.ch

- GitHub Pages only allows one custom (apex) domain.
- Technically: only one entry in the CNAME file

Probably the simplest solution to have another (apex) domain,
is to have a redirect. This is implemented here. It is a quick
solution, but not a particularly good one.
There is some debate about redirects and masking.

Better solution (but more work) is to have a copy of the repo
with another CNAME file (could create a fork), but not today.
**We should do this** (once time allows).
